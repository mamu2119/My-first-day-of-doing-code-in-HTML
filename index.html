        India gained independence from British rule on August 15, 1947.
         The Indian Independence Act came into effect on this day, which partitioned British India into the dominions of India and Pakistan.
          The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag at the Red Fort in Delhi to mark the occasion.
           Independence Day is celebrated with flag-hoisting ceremonies, parades, and cultural events.
